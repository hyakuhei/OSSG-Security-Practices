OSSG Security Practices Review & ToDo
=====================================

###Reviewed + spell checked
apply_restrictive_file_permissions.md
avoid_dangerous_input_parsing_libraries.md - not 100% happy with wording
pipes_to_avoid_shells.md
sensitive_config_file_options.md
shell_injection.md
use_oslo_rootwrap_conscientiously.md
use_secure_channels.md

###Reviewed & need work
cross_site_request_forgery.md - may need further explaination
path_traversal_problems.md - need to test examples.
parameterize_database_queries.md - simplify query examples?
strong_crypto.md - half-written by me, needs reviewing and password algorithm
unvalidated_redirect.md - 'correct' example needs review/simplification
validate_certificates.md - needs a fair bit of expansion
